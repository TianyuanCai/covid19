## Intro/Lit Review (current state of covid19 prediction, and how we are going to contribute)

## Data: The unique data set we were able to compile

### [Weather](https://developer.weathersource.com/tools/postman-collection-onpoint-api/)

There is a large number of columns here. It would be good to regularize the data set and identify the most important columns before writing up the variable description. The full set of variable descriptions are here.
